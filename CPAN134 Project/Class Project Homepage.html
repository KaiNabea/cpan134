                    Welcome to my personal website. My name is Kai Nabea, I am a computer programming student and 
                    this is a project that I am completing for my first semester at Humber Polytechnic. Since it's
                    my first semester, I won't have much to add to my portfolio but the more personal and educational
                    projects I get done, the more content I'll be able to add to this portfolio. As it stands right now
                    though, this website is my first real project. Thanks for visiting and stay tuned.
