                Early Life
            </h2>
            <p>    
                Born in Brampton, Canada in 1996, I spent much of my younger years traveling to new places.
                I'd moved to Rwanda in 1998. My paternal grandmother lived with us while there. Unfortunately, a
                tragedy eventually resulted in my family moving to Tanzania in 2001. After staying there for a
                year, my mother got a job in Vienna, Austria and we moved in 2002. I spent the next 8 years
                living there and learning German. Despite growing accustomed and developing a sense of home, I
                transferred to a boarding school in British Columbia, Canada in 2009. Upon graduating in 2014, I
                spent several years at a few universities in a Chemical Engineering program. However, the program
                didn't end up sitting well with me and I spent a few years working retail in Thunder Bay, Ontario
                from 2019 to 2022. Upon returning to Brampton, I spent a few more years working odd jobs before
                deciding to return to school by applying to Humber College for Computer Programming, where I've been
                studying ever since.
